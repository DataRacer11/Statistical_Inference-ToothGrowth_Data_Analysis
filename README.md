# Statistical_Inference-ToothGrowth_Data_Analysis

These are the unstructured project files for the statistical inference course. Simulation is used to explore inference 
and to perform some simple inferential data analysis. The project consists of two parts:

1. A simulation exercise.
2. Basic inferential data analysis.

Two reports for Part 1 & Part 2 have been created an have been uploaded to this repository to answer each of the project questions.
